# Description: Hastala Training Project

## To build and run the code:
* Type "make"
* If no errors are found, a binary called "unittest" will be created
* Just run "./unittest"

## How to debug if the code is not working correctly:
* For each file, one unit-test suit is defined (check unittest.cpp for more details)
* If the test(s) fail for each suit, it will let you know which test case
* Go to the code that fails, debug from there, using the same input from unittest.cpp
* You're welcome to add a main() function for each file to test it manually
